(* Risc86 is an invented RISC machine that shares the registers of the
x86 but has a load/store instruction set with 3-address arithmetic
arithmetic instructions and no restrictions on which registers can be
used in each instruction.  It's implemented by translation into real
x86 code, with the restrictions of the x86 removed by expanding
difficult instructions into multiple x86 instructions, and inserting a
move instruction inserted where an operation's result is in a
different register from its inputs.  The cost of this could, in
extreme cases, be high.  But provided the register allocator in the
compiler allocates the result of an operation when it can to the same
register as an input, and provided the other restriction affect only 
uncommon instructions -- as tends to be true -- the results are generally
good enough to be usable. *)
